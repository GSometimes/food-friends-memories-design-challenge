# Food. Friends. Memories.

The epicurean world has been graced by many, but few stand out quite like Alex Palmer. With a decade under her belt in the hospitality industry, Alex has mingled with the flavors of the world. Her zest for food, however, didn’t just end at savoring it, but in crafting it. As a Michelin Star Pastry Chef, Alex has brought smiles to thousands with her delicate and intricate pastries that are as much a visual treat as they are a culinary delight.

But the culinary journey isn’t just about food for Alex. It’s about the stories that are weaved around a table, the laughter that echoes when friends gather, and the nostalgia of childhood dishes. Realizing the strength of these intertwined elements - food, friends, and memories - Alex started her blog, hoping to share her tales and recipes with the world.

**“Savor the Moment, Relish the Memory.”**

| **Recommendations & Additional Notes:** | Consistency: With a clearly defined style guide in place, ensure that any new elements added to the page adhere to the guide for a cohesive look.<br> Performance: Since you're using transitions and transformations, test your website's performance across various devices to ensure smooth interactions.<br> Accessibility: Ensure that there's enough contrast between the text and the background for readability. Adjust brightness or add shadows if necessary.<br> Navigation: The hamburger menu's CSS suggests a mobile overlay navigation. Test its functionality on various devices for smooth user experience. |

# Hungry For More

Your landing page is looking great with its fresh design and clear branding. But why stop there? Let's take things to the next level by adding dynamic functionality and subtle animations to enhance user experience.

Here's a deeper dive you can take:

### **1. Dynamic Copyright Year**

A small touch, but updating the copyright year automatically can save you time and keep your site current:

- **JavaScript Date**: Research how to use the JavaScript `Date` object to get the current year and display it in your copyright section.

### **2. Dynamic Hamburger Menu**

The CSS for the hamburger menu is set, but it needs some JavaScript logic to become functional:

- **Toggle Functionality**: Add an event listener to the hamburger icon. When clicked, toggle a class like `.active` to display or hide the navigation menu.
- **Close on Link Click**: When a navigation link is clicked, the menu should automatically close on mobile views.

### **3. Staggered Animations**

Enhance the user's entrance to your site with staggered fade-in animations for your content:

- **Fade In**: Using JavaScript animate the opacity of your main content sections so they fade in one by one, instead of all at once.
- **Fade Out**: When navigating away or when closing certain components, use a fade-out animation to smoothen the transition.
